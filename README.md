# moreStrafts Mod

A mod that extends Straftat's multiplayer lobby max capacity from 4 players to **10 players**.

---

## Installation

Drop `MoreStrafts.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/`.

**Requires:** BepInEx 5.4.21+

## Usage

In the main menu, select your desired player count (2-10) from the **Max Players** dropdown before clicking Host. Do not change this setting after the lobby is created.

### Quick Load (New in 0.0.4)

Enable the **Quick Load** checkbox in the lobby to skip the post-round screen. This prevents the post-round bug.

### Known UI Limitations

- Lobby preview shows only 4 player slots (players 5-10 stack visually)
- End-round screen displays only the first 4 players
- Match points HUD (Tab) shows up to 4 teams
- Team selection dropdowns overlap for players 5-10
